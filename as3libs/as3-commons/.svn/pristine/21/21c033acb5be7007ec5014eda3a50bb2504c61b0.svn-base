Changes in version 1.3.1 (29.08.2010)
-------------------------------------

Package org.as3commons.reflect
* added support for type.getMetaDataContainers("MetadataName") to quickly retrieve all members that are decorated with specific metadata
* added support for Type.alias property. When registerClassAlias() has been invoked for a Class, the value of this alias will be stored in the Type.alias property. This will not work if registerClassAlias() has been called AFTER the Type has been created already. In that case, call Type.clearCache() and retrieve the Type again.
