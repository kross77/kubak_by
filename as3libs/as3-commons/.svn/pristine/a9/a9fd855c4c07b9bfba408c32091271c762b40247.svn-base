AS3COMMONS-BYTECODE CHANGELOG
============================

Note: dates are in DD.MM.YYYY format

Changes in version 0.9.6 (19.01.2011)
-----------------------------------

* Enhanced and fixed bugs in class introductions
* Multiple bug fixes in ABC serialization/deserialization


Changes in version 0.9.5 (14.01.2011)
-----------------------------------

* Added support for class introductions


Changes in version 0.9.4 (11.01.2011)
-----------------------------------

* Added support for proxying method that have rest arguments. (I.e. function(...rest):void)
* Fixed bugs in maxStack and localCount calculation for method bodies
* IMethodInvocationInterceptor instances are no longer injected as constructor arguments, enabling parameterless constructors for proxies. (Good for generating serialization objects)
* Added ByteCodeType.definitonNames, ByteCodeType.metaDataLookup, ByteCodeType.getCache() and ByteCodeType.getClassesWithMetaData() shortcut methods.

Changes in version 0.9.3 (05.01.2011)
-----------------------------------

* Added support for proxying interfaces (will create a class that implements the interface)
* Several speed optimizations in classmetadatadeserializer
* Fix: constructor argument is now typed to IMethodInvocationInterceptor instead of the concrete class

Changes in version 0.9.2 (29.12.2010)
-----------------------------------

General
* Fixed setting of method flags and subsequently serializing methods with optional arguments
* Added getProxyInfoForClass() method to IProxyFactory
* Added interceptorFactory method to ClassProxyInfo
* Fixed merging of member colections in ByteCodeType (no more duplicates)
* Fixed proxying of custom namespace scoped members
* Fixed properly setting namespaceURI and scopeName on BytecodeAccessor

Changes in version 0.9.1 (28.12.2010)
-----------------------------------

General
* Fixed proxying of protected members.
* Added ProxyFactoryBuildEvent to easily enable custom ctor/method/accessor body creation.

Changes in version 0.9 (26.12.2010)
-----------------------------------

General
* Added a check in ByteCodeTypeProvider that prevents a bytearray from being deserialized twice.
* Fixed generation of class level metadata on generated classes
* Fixed protected and custom namespace serialization for class members
* Fixed maximum stack calculation for method bodies
* Added proxy.* and interception.* packages for generating runtime dynamic proxy classes
* Added defineClass and defineInterface methods to IAbcBuilder to build classes and interfaces with fully qualified names
* Added support for manipulating existing classes in an Abc file
* Added alchemy specific opcodes
* Added buildAndExport() method to IAbcBuilder and implementation in AbcBuilder


Changes in version 0.8.5 (14.11.2010)
-----------------------------------

General
* Further maturation of the emit API, implemented backpatching (resolving of opcode jumps)
and added an asm parser/converter to enable importing of method bodies defined by string.

Changes in version 0.8.1 (02.11.2010)
-----------------------------------

General
* First iteration of the emit API, simple class generation implemented


Changes in version 0.7 (28.10.2010)
-----------------------------------

General
* Bunch of tweaks and bugfixes in the bytecode serialization and parsing
* Debugged support for all available opcodes
* Start of the emit API

Changes in version 0.6 (06.09.2010)
-----------------------------------

General
* Serialization and parsing of Abc bytecode fully functional
* Added some functionality to load and parse SWF files
* Implemented some of the more basic SWF tags

Changes in version 0.5 (27.06.2010)
-----------------------------------

General
* initial commit, only bytecode based reflection functional
